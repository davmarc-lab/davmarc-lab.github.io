                        Hello I'm Davide, I was born in the 12/24/2001 in Italy and I like coding ??.

                        I'm studying Computer Science and Engeneering at University of Bologna in the campus of Cesena.
                        In these year I studied a lot of things like computer graphics using OpenGL library using C++,
                        High Peformance Computing in MIMD and shared memory architecture, Operative System where I 
                        learn more about bash and since that moment I started using Arch as operating system.
                        I also studied math, physics, algebra, Numerical Method.
                        I'm currently studying Computer Vision in Python and when I have some free time I'm also 
                        learning Rust.

                    <p>
                        I started learning Programming Languages in High School and started making some little things in C++.
                        When I came to University I also studied Java then I did in a group project a game which emulates a simple
                        Risiko game between 3 players.
                        
                        After my little Java application I learned how to make a simple Game Engine using OpenGL library in C++,
                        I made a game which is called "Kart".
                        At the same time I attended High Performance Computing lessons acknowledging that this and Computer Graphics
                        are very related and foundamental for a proper game.
                        At that moment I started to get more interested in Linux and decided to make my own rice of Arch.
                        I had already used Ubuntu before and read a beautiful book about bash called "The Linux Command Line", using my
                        old and new knowledge I finally came up with a stable and usable operating system, stil not perfect.
                        After I riced Arch, my mind wanted to change IDE and start using NeoVim, I really liked it so much that I customized
                        NeoVim as well and I'm currently using it for literally everything. Even sometimes when I use Visual Studio Code I need
                        that Vim plugin, can't stop myself using Vim motions.
